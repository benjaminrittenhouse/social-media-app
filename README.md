# Social Media App
This social media app allows users to take pictures, upload pictures, caption them, and comment / follow other users accounts and see their pictures in a feed.

# Technologies
This project uses React Native to create the frontend and Firebase to store the user information in a database on the backend. I also utilized Expo to to testing within a web browser and on an iOS device. Redux was utilized for managing the state of the application.

# Testing & Design
Testing was done in mobile view and the app was designed for mobile via React Native. It is linked to firebase, so a lot of testing was removing and adding user information such as their posts, comments, and who they are following.

To utilize expo, install all dependencies and run "expo start -c" to run with a clear cache.
